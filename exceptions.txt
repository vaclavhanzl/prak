### exceptions.txt - additional pronunciation rules, see https://github.com/vaclavhanzl/prak
###
### Comment lines start with THREE hashes: "###".

### Write you rules here:




### Few examples. (You can delete this part, all rules below are also built in.)
### Write it the "normal" Czech way:
interview intervjů

### Help with ditini where needed, use "ň", "y" etc. (but it should be 98% correct by default):
nitrolak nytrolak

### Suggest seam. This rule helps for videoukázka, supervideoukázky etc.
videoukázk video=ukázk

### Use "+" for word begin/end. This rule wil NOT match e.g. "euroombudsman":
+room+ rům

### This rule allows pronunciations "jsem" and "sem", "jsi" and "si" etc.:
+js s js

### REMEMBER: This file must be saved as utf-8. NOT utf-16, NOT latin-XXX.
